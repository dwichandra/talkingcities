Talking Cities is the framework and protocol definition of Smart Cities communication

# Arabic Background
The project was inspired by United Arab Emirates vision to the future during their 50th anniversary of the country, where there is a mission of the next 50 years to come to be the most-everything in the world.

Talking Cities project was the name adopted from the final coursework of the first Author (dwichandra) for proposing Smart Cities communication framework and protocol.

The loose Arabic translation of the word Talking Cities is Hadeeth Modon, which gives birth to the division of the function and element of Talking Cities.

- Hadeeth, means talking, is the group of functions and modules covering the communication and data exchange
- Modon, means city, is the group of functions and modules covering the data storage, security, and access control within each city
